# 🧠 AI/LLM Experiments Repository

This repository is a structured collection of AI/LLM experiments and implementations built during my learning journey through **Scrimba's AI Engineering Course**. It spans from foundational LLM SDK usage to fine-tuning, embeddings, vector databases, and initial agent setups using the **ReAct framework**.

---

## 📂 Project Structure & Modules

### 1. `LLM-SDK-Usages`
Basic usage of different LLM SDKs, including configuration tweaks and penalty settings to control model outputs.

> 🛠️ **Recent Update**: Added token and temperature penalties to manage output behavior.

---

### 2. `Fine-Tune-LLM`
Initial scaffolding for fine-tuning LLMs on custom datasets.

> 🧠 **Recent Update**: Introduced fine-tuning steps and sample scripts.

---

### 3. `HuggingFace-Model-Usage`
Working with HuggingFace’s **image-to-image models** using `Transformers` and `Diffusers`.

> 🖼️ **Recent Update**: Integrated image-to-image model usage and inference.

---

### 4. `Model-Building-Transformer.js`
JavaScript-based module using `Transformer.js` to build and execute transformer models in the browser.

> 🌐 **Recent Update**: Added sample models and demo scripts.

---

### 5. `Running-Ollama-Model`
Scripts and instructions for running LLMs locally using the **Ollama SDK**.

> 🤖 **Recent Update**: Added local model execution and SDK-based interaction.

---

### 6. `Text-Embeddings`
Scripts for generating and applying **text embeddings** in various NLP tasks.

> 🔍 **Recent Update**: Solved embedding pairings and assignment-based operations.

---

### 7. `Vector-DB-via-Supabase`
Semantic search setup using embeddings with **Supabase vector DB**, combined with OpenAI for response generation.

> 📚 **Recent Update**: Enhanced conversational context from vector search results.

---

### 8. `Chunking-text-from-documents`
Extracts and chunks text from documents, stores them for embedding and vector usage. Includes a basic frontend.

> 💾 **Recent Update**: Added UI and object persistence support.

---

### 9. `AI-Agents`
Partial setup of autonomous **AI agents** using the ReAct framework, exploring reasoning and action planning.

> 🧪 **Recent Update**: Initial ReAct framework integration (in progress).

---

### 🛑 `.gitignore`
This is a JavaScript/CSS/HTML-based project. The `.gitignore` is modeled on typical frontend setups and was configured as part of the learning process.
