This repository is a structured collection of AI/LLM experiments and implementations that I've built while learning from Scrimba's AI Engineering course. It covers everything from foundational LLM SDK usage to fine-tuning, embedding, vector databases, and partial agent setups using the ReAct framework.

📂 Project Structure & Modules
Below are the key components and directories of the repository:

1. LLM-SDK-Usages
Basic usage of different LLM SDKs including configuration and penalty adjustments to control model responses.

🛠️ Recent Update: Added token and temperature penalties to manage output behavior.

2. Fine-Tune-LLM
Initial setup for fine-tuning large language models on custom datasets.

🧠 Recent Update: Introduced steps and sample scripts for fine-tuning.

3. HuggingFace-Model-Usage
Working with HuggingFace's image-to-image models using the Transformers and Diffusers libraries.

🖼️ Recent Update: Integrated image-to-image model usage and inference.

4. Model-Building-Transformer.js
A JavaScript-based module using Transformer.js to build and run transformer models directly in the browser.

🌐 Recent Update: Added sample models and demo scripts.

5. Running-Ollama-Model
Instructions and scripts to run and interact with LLMs via the Ollama SDK.

🤖 Recent Update: Added local model execution and calling it using Ollama SDK.

6. Text-Embeddings
Solutions and scripts for generating text embeddings and using them for downstream NLP tasks.

🔍 Recent Update: Solved embedding pairings and assignment-based text operations.

7. Vector-DB-via-Supabase
Semantic search setup using embeddings and Supabase vector database, combined with OpenAI to generate conversational responses.

📚 Recent Update: Enhanced conversational context from vector search results.

8. Chunking-text-from-documents
Text chunking from documents and persisting them for embedding and vector storage. A simple frontend was also added.

💾 Recent Update: Added a frontend UI and basic object persistence support.

9. AI-Agents
Partial setup of AI agents using the ReAct framework. This module explores autonomous reasoning and action selection by agents.

🧪 Recent Update: ReAct framework integration begun—still in progress.

🛑 .gitignore
This project primarily contains JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files. The .gitignore file is based on typical frontend setups and was created as part of the learning process.

📅 Commit Highlights
Last Update: Partial AI agent setup via ReAct (91c86a4) — last week

Fine-tuning, image models, Ollama integration, and chunking added 2 weeks ago
